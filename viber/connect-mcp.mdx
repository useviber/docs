This guide shows how to connect your MCP server to Viber so your IDE/AI agent can interact with your running app via the Viber CLI and communication layer.

## Prerequisites

- Viber CLI installed globally (auto-installs MCP on postinstall):

```bash
npm i -g @useviber/cli
```

<Tip>
If auto-install fails due to permissions, run: `viber mcp:install` or `npm i -g @useviber/mcp`.
</Tip>

## 1) Start Viber CLI in your project

Run from your project directory:

```bash
viber start
```

This serves the universal plugin and connects the CLI to the Viber Communication Server.

## 2) Ensure MCP API key is available

Viber stores your MCP API key after authentication in one of:

- `~/.viber/mcp-api-key.json` (preferred)
- `~/.viber/auth.json` (also contains `mcpApiKey`)

Check status:

```bash
viber mcp:status
```

## 3) Configure your IDE/agent to launch MCP

Most IDEs/agents allow configuring an MCP server command. Example (Cursor `.cursor/mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "viber": {
      "command": "viber-mcp",
      "args": ["start"],
      "env": {
        "PORT": "3337"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Notes:
- `viber-mcp` is installed globally by `@useviber/mcp`.
- The `args` array is optional; `viber-mcp` starts without args as well.
- `PORT` defaults to `3337` if not provided.

## 4) Run MCP manually (optional)

If you want to run MCP yourself:

```bash
viber-mcp
# or
npx @useviber/mcp
```

## 5) Verify connection

- In your IDE/agent, enable the configured MCP server named `viber`.
- Check CLI logs while `viber start` is running – MCP connection updates will appear once the server reports status.

## Troubleshooting

- "command not found: viber-mcp" → run `viber mcp:install`.
- No API key → `viber login`, then re-run `viber mcp:status`.
- Port in use → set a different `PORT` in your MCP config and restart.
